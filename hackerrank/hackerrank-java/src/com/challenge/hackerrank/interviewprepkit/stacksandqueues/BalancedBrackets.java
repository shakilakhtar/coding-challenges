/**
 * A bracket is considered to be any one of the following characters: (, ), {, }, [, or ].
 * <p>
 * Two brackets are considered to be a matched pair if the an opening bracket (i.e., (, [, or {) occurs to the left of a closing bracket (i.e., ), ], or }) of the exact same type. There are three types of matched pairs of brackets: [], {}, and ().
 * <p>
 * A matching pair of brackets is not balanced if the set of brackets it encloses are not matched. For example, {[(])} is not balanced because the contents in between { and } are not balanced. The pair of square brackets encloses a single, unbalanced opening bracket, (, and the pair of parentheses encloses a single, unbalanced closing square bracket, ].
 * <p>
 * By this logic, we say a sequence of brackets is balanced if the following conditions are met:
 * <p>
 * It contains no unmatched brackets.
 * The subset of brackets enclosed within the confines of a matched pair of brackets is also a matched pair of brackets.
 * Given  strings of brackets, determine whether each sequence of brackets is balanced. If a string is balanced, return YES. Otherwise, return NO.
 * <p>
 * Function Description
 * <p>
 * Complete the function isBalanced in the editor below. It must return a string: YES if the sequence is balanced or NO if it is not.
 * <p>
 * isBalanced has the following parameter(s):
 * <p>
 * s: a string of brackets
 * Input Format
 * <p>
 * The first line contains a single integer , the number of strings.
 * Each of the next  lines contains a single string , a sequence of brackets.
 * <p>
 * Constraints
 * <p>
 * , where  is the length of the sequence.
 * All chracters in the sequences âˆˆ { {, }, (, ), [, ] }.
 * Output Format
 * <p>
 * For each string, return YES or NO.
 * <p>
 * Sample Input
 * <p>
 * 3
 * {[()]}
 * {[(])}
 * {{[[(())]]}}
 * Sample Output
 * <p>
 * YES
 * NO
 * YES
 * Explanation
 * <p>
 * The string {[()]} meets both criteria for being a balanced string, so we print YES on a new line.
 * The string {[(])} is not balanced because the brackets enclosed by the matched pair { and } are not balanced: [(]).
 * The string {{[[(())]]}} meets both criteria for being a balanced string, so we print YES on a new line.
