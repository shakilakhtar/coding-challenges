/**
 * Karl loves playing games on social networking sites. His current favorite is CandyMaker, where the goal is to make candies.
 * <p>
 * Karl just started a level in which he must accumulate  candies starting with  machines and  workers. In a single pass, he can make  candies. After each pass, he can decide whether to spend some of his candies to buy more machines or hire more workers. Buying a machine or hiring a worker costs  units, and there is no limit to the number of machines he can own or workers he can employ.
 * <p>
 * Karl wants to minimize the number of passes to obtain the required number of candies at the end of a day. Determine that number of passes.
 * <p>
 * For example, Karl starts with  machine and  workers. The cost to purchase or hire,  and he needs to accumulate  candies. He executes the following strategy:
 * <p>
 * Make  candies. Purchase two machines.
 * Make  candies. Purchase  machines and hire  workers.
 * Make  candies. Retain all  candies.
 * Make  candies. With yesterday's production, Karl has  candies.
 * It took  passes to make enough candies.
 * <p>
 * Function Description
 * <p>
 * Complete the minimumPasses function in the editor below. The function must return a long integer representing the minimum number of passes required.
 * <p>
 * minimumPasses has the following parameter(s):
 * <p>
 * m: long integer, the starting number of machines
 * w: long integer, the starting number of workers
 * p: long integer, the cost of a new hire or a new machine
 * n: long integer, the number of candies to produce
 * Input Format
 * <p>
 * A single line consisting of four space-separated integers describing the values of , , , and , the starting number of machines and workers, the cost of a new machine or a new hire, and the the number of candies Karl must accumulate to complete the level.
 * <p>
 * Constraints
 * <p>
 * Output Format
 * <p>
 * Return a long integer denoting the minimum number of passes required to accumulate at least  candies.
 * <p>
 * Sample Input
 * <p>
 * 3 1 2 12
 * Sample Output
 * <p>
 * 3
 * Explanation
 * <p>
 * Karl makes three passes:
 * <p>
 * In the first pass, he makes  candies. He then spends  of them hiring another worker, so  and he has one candy left over.
 * In the second pass, he makes  candies. He spends  of them on another machine and another worker, so  and  and he has  candies left over.
 * In the third pass, Karl makes  candies. Because this satisfies his goal of making at least  candies, we print the number of passes (i.e., ) as our answer.
