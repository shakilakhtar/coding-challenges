/**
 * A binary tree is a tree which is characterized by one of the following properties:
 * <p>
 * It can be empty (null).
 * It contains a root node only.
 * It contains a root node with a left subtree, a right subtree, or both. These subtrees are also binary trees.
 * In-order traversal is performed as
 * <p>
 * Traverse the left subtree.
 * Visit root.
 * Traverse the right subtree.
 * For this in-order traversal, start from the left child of the root node and keep exploring the left subtree until you reach a leaf. When you reach a leaf, back up to its parent, check for a right child and visit it if there is one. If there is not a child, you've explored its left and right subtrees fully. If there is a right child, traverse its left subtree then its right in the same manner. Keep doing this until you have traversed the entire tree. You will only store the values of a node as you visit when one of the following is true:
 * <p>
 * it is the first node visited, the first time visited
 * it is a leaf, should only be visited once
 * all of its subtrees have been explored, should only be visited once while this is true
 * it is the root of the tree, the first time visited
 * Swapping: Swapping subtrees of a node means that if initially node has left subtree L and right subtree R, then after swapping, the left subtree will be R and the right subtree, L.
 * <p>
 * For example, in the following tree, we swap children of node 1.
 * <p>
 * Depth
 * 1               1            [1]
 * / \             / \
 * 2   3     ->    3   2          [2]
 * \   \           \   \
 * 4   5           5   4        [3]
 * In-order traversal of left tree is 2 4 1 3 5 and of right tree is 3 5 1 2 4.
 * <p>
 * Swap operation:
 * <p>
 * We define depth of a node as follows:
 * <p>
 * The root node is at depth 1.
 * If the depth of the parent node is d, then the depth of current node will be d+1.
 * Given a tree and an integer, k, in one operation, we need to swap the subtrees of all the nodes at each depth h, where h âˆˆ [k, 2k, 3k,...]. In other words, if h is a multiple of k, swap the left and right subtrees of that level.
 * <p>
 * You are given a tree of n nodes where nodes are indexed from [1..n] and it is rooted at 1. You have to perform t swap operations on it, and after each swap operation print the in-order traversal of the current state of the tree.
 * <p>
 * Function Description
 * <p>
 * Complete the swapNodes function in the editor below. It should return a two-dimensional array where each element is an array of integers representing the node indices of an in-order traversal after a swap operation.
 * <p>
 * swapNodes has the following parameter(s):
 * - indexes: an array of integers representing index values of each , beginning with , the first element, as the root.
 * - queries: an array of integers, each representing a  value.
 * <p>
 * Input Format
 * The first line contains n, number of nodes in the tree.
 * <p>
 * Each of the next n lines contains two integers, a b, where a is the index of left child, and b is the index of right child of ith node.
 * <p>
 * Note: -1 is used to represent a null node.
 * <p>
 * The next line contains an integer, t, the size of .
 * Each of the next t lines contains an integer , each being a value .
 * <p>
 * Output Format
 * For each k, perform the swap operation and store the indices of your in-order traversal to your result array. After all swap operations have been performed, return your result array for printing.
 * <p>
 * Constraints
 * <p>
 * Either  or
 * Either  or
 * The index of a non-null child will always be greater than that of its parent.

 * As nodes 2 and 3 have no children, swapping will not have any effect on them. We only have to swap the child nodes of the root node.
